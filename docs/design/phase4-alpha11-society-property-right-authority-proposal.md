# Alpha 1.1 Society PropertyRight authority proposal

Status: **Review only / approval pending**

Tracking: #240
Implementation after approval: #265

## Purpose

This document proposes an exact benchmark-only authority for the remaining `society.property_right` 50,000-record slice.

The generic payload accepts an `asset_ref`, but the existing contracts do not say that any particular production partition is an economic property asset. Therefore the target choice below is an explicit semantic decision and must not be inferred merely from Ref/schema compatibility.

## Existing authority and implementation facts

The following are already established:

- `Qa04ReferenceWorldMaterialContractV1` marks `physical.d0-presence` as `ProductionMaterializerAvailable` with canonical count 500,000 and primary partition `physical.presence`;
- `Qa04ReferenceWorldDependencyContractV1` has no remaining Physical Presence materialization blocker;
- `Qa04PhysicalD0MaterializerV1` creates actual `physical.presence` records using the existing QA-04 Physical descriptor RecordId and explicit canonical genesis bindings; descriptor-only refs are not sufficient proof;
- canonical Resident identity authority is available for at least ordinals `0..49,999`;
- the standard PropertyRight payload is `asset_ref`, `holder_ref`, `right_kind`, `share_ppm`, `effective_from`, optional `effective_until`, optional `claim_ref`;
- standard derived indexes are `society.property-by-asset` and `society.property-by-holder`;
- the generic payload validator checks referenced records for existence and an allowed standard record schema, but does not itself choose the economic meaning of `asset_ref`.

## Recommended benchmark mapping

For local ordinal `p = 0..49,999`:

```text
asset_ref       = PhysicalPresence[p]
holder_ref      = Resident[p]
right_kind      = perf.ownership
share_ppm       = 1,000,000
effective_from  = 0
effective_until = NONE
claim_ref       = NONE
```

Envelope:

```text
record_id    = existing QA-04 society.property_right descriptor RecordId for p
revision     = 1
created_step = 0
retired_step = NONE
detail_level = D2
lineage_ref  = NONE
```

No new identity recipe is introduced.

## Exact proposed semantics

Approval of this package would mean only the following for `perf.reference.v1` Alpha 1.1:

- the first 50,000 actual canonical `physical.presence` records are accepted as benchmark economic asset targets for this PropertyRight slice;
- the first 50,000 canonical Residents are the corresponding benchmark holders, one-to-one by ordinal;
- each selected asset has exactly one proposed PropertyRight record and a full `1,000,000 ppm` share in this slice;
- `perf.ownership` is a benchmark fixture Token, not a complete legal-right ontology;
- `effective_from=0` and `effective_until=NONE` define the benchmark genesis period only;
- `claim_ref=NONE` avoids fabricating a ContractClaim, legal instrument, court judgment, registry entry, or other supporting claim.

## Important boundaries

This proposal deliberately does **not** mean:

- that every `physical.presence` record is generally ownable;
- that the Presence record is the universal long-term identity of a legal asset;
- that ownership of Presence implies ownership of its underlying subject, land, structure, container, material, or geometry in the general model;
- that a `physical.presence` is a `built.structure`, facility, building, service endpoint, or Infrastructure `facility_ref`;
- that this decision resolves the `infrastructure.facility_service` blocker;
- that possession, occupancy, effective control, territorial claim, and property ownership are equivalent;
- that transfers, inheritance, liens, leases, layered rights, fractional co-ownership, registration, taxation, or enforcement are defined;
- that the benchmark token `perf.ownership` constrains a future general right-kind ontology.

The mapping is a narrow benchmark fixture chosen because actual canonical Physical Presence authority already exists and the PropertyRight contract intentionally accepts a cross-domain asset Ref.

## Cardinality and uniqueness

The proposed mapping has these exact properties:

- 50,000 PropertyRight records;
- 50,000 distinct actual PhysicalPresence assets;
- 50,000 distinct canonical Resident holders;
- one PropertyRight record per selected asset;
- one selected asset per holder in this benchmark slice;
- every record has `share_ppm=1,000,000`;
- no overlapping share aggregate exists for the selected assets within this slice;
- all `(asset_ref, holder_ref, right_kind)` tuples are unique.

## Required production proof after approval

Accepted accounting must not change until #265 proves all of the following on one current head:

1. exactly 50,000 PropertyRight records through the production payload validator;
2. exact existing QA-04 PropertyRight descriptor/envelope binding for every ordinal;
3. `asset_ref` closure to **actual records produced through the canonical Physical D0 production materialization path** for Physical ordinals `0..49,999`; descriptor-only existence, fabricated Presence records, or an exists-everywhere resolver are forbidden;
4. `holder_ref` closure to actual canonical Resident ordinals `0..49,999`;
5. exactly 50,000 distinct assets and 50,000 distinct holders;
6. exact one-to-one ordinal mapping and unique `(asset, holder, right_kind)` relation keys;
7. exact `perf.ownership`, `share_ppm=1,000,000`, Step 0, effective-until NONE, and claim NONE values;
8. full population share aggregation proving exactly 1,000,000 ppm on every selected asset in this slice;
9. both required secondary indexes rebuilt from production records with exactly 50,000 asset keys x1 and 50,000 holder keys x1;
10. full 50,000-record Snapshot encode / recovery / semantic rehash;
11. fail-closed negative proof for missing/wrong PhysicalPresence, wrong asset partition, missing/wrong Resident, wrong holder partition, wrong Token, share drift/out-of-range, period drift, claim injection, duplicate asset/right relation, duplicate RecordId, population drift, and index cardinality drift;
12. generic Simulation Core smoke plus full current-head CI.

If the implementation cannot source the first 50,000 Presence records through the already-declared production materializer without introducing any additional semantic/genesis decision, the proof must fail closed and this proposal must return to audit rather than substituting descriptor refs.

## Acceptance accounting if approved and fully proven

Current accepted accounting remains:

```text
Society/Governance accepted = 1,601,200 / 2,000,000
Society/Governance remaining =   398,800
Society remaining            =   139,800
Governance remaining         =   259,000
```

Only after approval plus all production proof above succeeds:

```text
Society/Governance accepted = 1,651,200 / 2,000,000
Society/Governance remaining =   348,800
Society remaining            =    89,800
Governance remaining         =   259,000
```

Other reference-world, Infrastructure, workload, Operation, and release flags remain unchanged.

## Explicit non-decisions

This proposal does not decide the remaining Society slices:

- `society.business_production` 30,000;
- `society.logistics_obligation` 40,000;
- `society.history_lineage` 19,800.

It also does not alter Governance or Infrastructure authority.
